This project provides a basic template for a bare-bones YTO SpringBoot project.

It contains:
-a pom.xml
-properties config sample file
-an application file with "main" method
-the option of running the app by itself with an embedded tomcat container (easier for dev)
-the option of adding the app to an external tomcat container
-a sample config class
-a secondary config class (exists just as a sample of how to do it)
-an application context class that overrides the default context class
-a context event listener class (probably never will be necessary)
-a sample controller
-a sample service
-a sample Thymeleaf template
